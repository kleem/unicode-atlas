Unicode Atlas
=============

Unicode Atlas is an interactive visualization of the whole "space" of [Unicode](http://unicode.org/) codepoints. Go to http://wafi.iit.cnr.it/multilingualweb/unicode/ and zoom into the map to see characters from all over the world!

Like a geographical Atlas, we provide different maps, that we show as layers you can select.
